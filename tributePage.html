                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)
                    was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002
                    to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
                    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                    and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                    ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the
                    original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                    Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.</p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After
                    completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                    where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in
                    Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                    dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project
                    was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said
                    to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly
                    missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
                    eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>

                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                    Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
                    Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was
                    transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of
                    India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
                    near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                    independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the
                    programme to include more engineers.


                    Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
                    In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space
                    Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s,
                    Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both
                    of which proved to be successful.</p>

                <h3>Achivements</h3>
                <p>Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The Government of India honoured him with
                    the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his
                    role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian
                    honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of
                    defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National
                    Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".

                    In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.

                    Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced
                    that his birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the
                    state government further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram
                    gold medal, a certificate and â‚¹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on
                    Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting
                    scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students.

                    On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression
                    series.

                    Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan
                    in New Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.</p>

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra, followed by
                    three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 - 7 March 2021),
                    Mustafa Kalam and Kasim Mohammed. He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended
                    families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations,
                    himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

                    Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was in
                    the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included
                    his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no
                    will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.</p>
